	wow... so meta:
		flag: flag{EEe_x_I_FFf}
		solution: use exiftool to found flag in the metadata.

	Binwalk:
		flag: ABCTF{b1nw4lk_is_us3ful}
		solution: file command say it's png, but file name is jpg, binwalk command says there are two png binary, extract it with binwalk -D='.*' filename. to extract all files. then we can find a png file with the flag.

	Exif:
		flag: flag{3l1t3_3x1f_4uth0r1ty_dud3br0}
		solution: using Exiftool on the to see the flag in the metadata.

	Rubber Duck:
		challenge no: 933
		flag: CTFlearn{ILoveJakarta}
		solution: using exiftool -b filename to extract binary data from metadata to see file. also can be found by `strings filename | grep -i ctf` to see the flag.

	07601:
		challenge no: 97
		flag: ABCTF{Du$t1nS_D0jo}
		solution: binwalk showed binary footprints of 3 zip files. extracted them using binwalk -D='.*' filename. using estrings in one of the zip file we got the flag. `strings filename | grep -i ctf` reveals the flag.

	Git Is Good:
		challenge no: 104
		flag: flag{protect_your_git}
		solution: `unzip filename`. then foud a folder with .git initialized. `git show` command reveals the old commits. and we can see the flag now.

	I'm a dump:
		challenge no: 883
		flag: CTFlearn{fl4ggyfl4g}

	Brute Force is Fun!:
		challenge no: 365
		flag: FLAG{may_the_brute_force_be_with_you}
		solution: with `binwalk -D='.*' filename` extract the files. it was a password protected zip file. `running 7z x zipfile` would extract any other files that aren't password protected. found a clue file with password formate ctflag****** where * means a number. generated a custom passfile. `zip2john zipfile > hash` now ready to crack zip with custom dictionary. `john hash --wordlist=custompass` found the password. unzip file with password found another flag.zip file. `unzip flag.zip`. found a base64 encoded text. `echo base64encodedtext | base64 -d`. found the flag.

	Snowboard:
		Challenge no: 934
		flag: CTFlearn{SkiBanff}
		solution: exiftool reveals a fake flag, `file filename` commad reveals a hiddent base64 encoded comment in file type. wich lead us to actual flag.


	PikesPeak:
		challenge no: 935
		flag: CTFlearn{Gandalf}
		solution: `strings PikesPeak.jpg | grep -i ctf` showed many flags with different flag formates. correct one has the correct flag format. flag format is CTFlearn{}

	Tux!:
		challenge no: 973
		flag: CTFlearn{Linux_Is_Awesome}
		solution: exiftool reveals a base64 encode password. found a zip binary footprint in the file with binwalk command. it was a password protected zip file. using the password found previously to unzip it found the flag file.

	PDF by fdpumyp:
		challenge: 957
		flag: CTFlearn{)_1l0w3y0Um00my123}
		solution: using strings, we got base64 encoded messages wich reveals the messy flag.

	Minions:
		challenge no: 955
		flag: CTFlearn{M1NI0NS_ARE_C00L}
		solution: `binwalk -D='.*' filename` extracted the rar file. `unrar x filename` rarreveals MEGA link. can be done with `strings` command. again another jpg file repeating the same process. found YouWin(almost).jpg file. `strings filename` reveals a base64 encoded string. decoding it 4 times reveals the flag.

	Chalkboard:
		challenge no: 972
		flag: CTFlearn{I_Like_Math_2_5}
		solution: have to solved two math equation for x and y. problem can be found in the metadata.
