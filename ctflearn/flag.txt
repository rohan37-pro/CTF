	Binwalk:
		flag: ABCTF{b1nw4lk_is_us3ful}
		solution: file command say it's png, but file name is jpg, binwalk command says there are two png binary, extract it with binwalk -D='.*' filename. to extract all files. then we can find a png file with the flag.

		solution: using Exiftool on the to see the flag in the metadata.

	Rubber Duck:
		challenge no: 933
		flag: CTFlearn{ILoveJakarta}
		solution: using exiftool -b filename to extract binary data from metadata to see file. also can be found by `strings filename | grep -i ctf` to see the flag.

	07601:
		challenge no: 97
		flag: ABCTF{Du$t1nS_D0jo}
		solution: binwalk showed binary footprints of 3 zip files. extracted them using binwalk -D='.*' filename. using estrings in one of the zip file we got the flag. `strings filename | grep -i ctf` reveals the flag.

	Git Is Good:

	Snowboard:
